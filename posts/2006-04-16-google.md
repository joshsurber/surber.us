I use Google products religiously. There. I said it.

Any mail I am receive is procmail-ed to [GMail](http://mail.google.com). I read everyone’s blog through [Google Reader](http://reader.google.com). I manage my bookmarks through [Google Bookmarks](http://google.com/bookmarks). I even have a recipe or two saved on [Google Base](http://base.google.com) <ins>(RIP)</ins>.

Why do I use Google? Simplicity. With a broadband connection, even with my slow computer, Google’s apps are faster than something running locally more often than not. And since my information is saved to Google’s computers, I don’t have anything to back up other than my music.

I do have a couple of issues with these products. Reader <ins>(RIP)</ins> needs a “Mark all read” button, though this can be hacked around with Greasemonkey. Calendar seems to have problems keeping the event bars lined up with the times in the grid, which I can forgive for now since it is three days old. <ins>Edit: I was using a Camino nightly build. I am now using the stable and this problem went away.</ins> Bookmarks should be exportable.

But other than these couple of issues, I love Google’s services. I could use another reader, but then I would have another site to remember to visit, another password to remember, my personal information on some other company’s computers. It just isn’t worth it for small quibbles.

As for privacy, I am not worried. Google refused a government order to turn over search results that didn’t even ask for user names. They use my search history to give me ads I will want to click. So? I found [ThinkGeek](http://www.thinkgeek.com) from a banner ad and it is now my favorite shopping site online. Privacy nuts should be more worried about their <acronym title="Internet Service Providers">ISP</acronym>s who have **ALL** your information pass through their pipes.

Lay off Google.
