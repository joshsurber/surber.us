    Greatest day of my life was marrying <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=vixenlenore">@vixenlenore</a> in 2005. Very close second was seeing <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=garbage">@garbage</a> live and in person tonight.

When [@vixenlenore](https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=vixenlenore) and I first met in April 2003, there was not much we had in common music-wise. She liked music I had previously liked but no longer listened to. She had not heard most of the music I liked. The biggest common denominator we both liked was [Garbage](http://garbage.com). We had both been fans since [their first album](http://amzn.to/2ccCzkl) was released in 1995. We are both still fans, and have been fans longer than any other band either of us listen to.

Last Saturday, I took a rare weekend day off of work and we went to see them on their [Strange Little Birds tour](https://garbage.com/tour/), promoting [their new album](http://amzn.to/2c8xDi9). It was only the second time we had gone to a concert together, and the first time either of us had seen them live.

It was awesome! I took several [pictures and videos](https://goo.gl/photos/Ct7ALssZaymNBzgx7). We had an amazingÂ time, though our feet really hurt by the time it was all over.

Protip: when going to a concert that is standing room only wear comfortable shoes.

Totally worth it though. We had an amazing time, and if they are going through your town on their tour you are missing out if you don&#8217;t go see them.
