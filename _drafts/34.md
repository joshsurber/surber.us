# How I manage with just 34 keys

I recently fell down the rabbit hole of minimal keyboards. I have been interested in mechanical keyboards since seeing the [Ultimate Hacking Keyboard](https://ultimatehackingkeyboard.com/) on Twitter a few years ago, but my interest in minimal keebs began when I saw [DistroTube review the Planck EZ](https://youtu.be/SZrgYPL-ZyUI). I have previously seen smaller keyboards before, of course, but never thought that they would be useable. After seeing that DT was able to use it, and explain how easy it is to use, I was interested. As the Planck is very expensive, I started doing research before making a commitment. And like anyone researching keyboards, I stumbled on [Ben Vallack's keyboard playlist on YouTube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCZYyvXAdQpsEWfa6OEBOhHn48SWgneoD).

Ben began his journey with a Planck EZ, but wound up removing keys, with the original stated goal of no key being more than one key away from the home position. He finally settled on a 18-key layout that works well for him.

Fuck that. I want all my letters available at once. I am currently using a [MK-47 from MicroCenter](https://www.microcenter.com/product/661264/inland-47-keys-hot-swappable-rgb-wired-mechanical-keyboard), which I picked up for about $50. This includes mediocre switches (no-name reds) and RGB lighting. Not the best keyboard by any means, but it gave me an idea of whether I should go any smaller than the 60% I was using before. I have been using it for almost a month now, and while I will not be sticking with it, that will be due to the limitations of the board rather than of the form factor. I will post a full review of this keyboard in the next few days.

I got this board to try smaller form factors, but have been quite curious about the 34 key layout. It seems to have the perfect number of keys to make each one easily accessable. In one of Ben's earlier videos, he [created a 36 key layout on his Planck]
