# How I manage with just 34 keys

I recently fell down the rabbit hole of minimal keyboards. I have been interested in mechanical keyboards since seeing the [Ultimate Hacking Keyboard](https://ultimatehackingkeyboard.com/) on Twitter a few years ago, but my interest in minimal keebs began when I saw [DistroTube review the Planck EZ](https://youtu.be/SZrgYPL-ZyUI). I have previously seen smaller keyboards before, of course, but never thought that they would be useable. After seeing that DT was able to use it, and explain how easy it is to use, I was interested. As the Planck is very expensive, I started doing research before making a commitment. And like anyone researching keyboards, I stumbled on [Ben Vallack's keyboard playlist on YouTube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCZYyvXAdQpsEWfa6OEBOhHn48SWgneoD).

Ben began his journey with a Planck EZ, but wound up removing keys, with the original stated goal of no key being more than one key away from the home position.
