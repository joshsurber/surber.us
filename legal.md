## Email Policy

By sending me email, you agree to the following:

- I am, by definition, “the intended recipient”.
- All information in the email is mine to do with as I see fit and make such financial profit, political mileage, or good joke as it lends itself to. In particular, I may quote it where I please.
- I may take the contents as representing the views of your company.
- This disclaimer overrides any disclaimer or statement of confidentiality that may be included on your message.

## Privacy Policy

This site does not collect personal information, with the exception of what you enter into contact forms. If you don't like that, don't fill out the forms.

## Affiliate Links

Some links on this site are affiliate links. While I do not use actual ads, purchasing items from some of the links I post will result in me getting a cut. I will not allow any compensation of any form to influence how I review or recommend any product, however, and if I am giving an affiliate item more than a passing link (such as a review) I will clearly state as such.
